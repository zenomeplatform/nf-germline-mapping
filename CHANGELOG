## Changelog

PR centric changelog with description of notable changes implemented in a PR.

v0.2 - 29/02/2021 - MultiQC changes, metadata from file name
  Added:
    - Metadata retrieval from fq file names in the input channel (bio-type, seq-type, seq-machine, flowcell-ID, lane, barcode). This is optional and can be switched off by using --metadata_from_file_name false *true by default)
    - Check for correct metadata naming format for fq file (if --metadata_from_file_name is true, as it is by default)
    - Check for matching smaple_id specified in csv file and in fq file name (can be turned off by --double_check_sample_id false, true buy default)
    - Process multiqc_prealignment_report_by_sample to create smaller realignment multiqc reports for each batch of files that corresponds to same sample_id.
  Fixed:
    - Multiqc not showing fastqc report for trimmed reads (reason - "_trimmed" substrings are automatically removed from file names by multiqc before plotting, so the trimmed pair overwrote the untrimmed pair and showed up as untrimmed pair in the report)
  Changes:
    - Required input name format now needs to have also the "bio-type" field, so the example data for test2 has been changed on s3 bucket (old files retained for old tests)



v0.1 - 29/02/2021 - Adds first pipeline template and 4 steps
  Added:
    - the basic piplene infrastrucure with multiple auxiliary elements;
    - reading input from input csv file with sample name and paths to fastq files;
    - first 4 pipeline steps:
        1. initial fastqc on raw data,
        2. read quality filtering and trimming with flexbar,
        3. secondary fastqc,
        4. collective multiqc;
    - test profiles:
        1. with public tiny s3 data,
        2. with private tiny s3 data;
    - two ci tests for the above.
